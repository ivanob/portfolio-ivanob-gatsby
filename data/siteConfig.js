  authorDescription: `
  <p>With over 12 years of professional experience in software engineering, I have expertise in <b>full stack</b> development and <b>designing high-quality software systems</b>. While my strength lies in backend development, 
  I have also gained experience working as a designer/frontend engineer for a couple of years. I specialize in assisting startups in rapidly scaling up and delivering their products with the utmost
  speed ðŸš€ and highest attainable quality ðŸ‘Œ. I am highly goal-focused, consistently recognizing the relationship between business value and cost while delivering new work.</p>
 
  <p>My main areas of interest are:
  <ul>
    <li>Functional Programming</li>
    <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/event-driven-architecture/">Event Driven Architectures</a> and Distributed Systems</li>
    <li><a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Clean Architectures</a> and <a href="https://www.domainlanguage.com/ddd/">Domain Driven Design</a></li>
    <li>Blockchain Technology</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>My most recent working experience is Typescript/JS, AWS services, Terraform, React, Nest.js, MongoDB/Postgres. Currently, I am involved in the design of event-driven architectures
  using AWS with special attention to performance and cost. I am <b>freelancing</b> for remote positions (or based in Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹)</p>
