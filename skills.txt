original description:
Software engineer with +10 years of professional experience in Full stack development. I am focusing on backend development although I have held some pure frontend roles in the past. I hold a Bachelor's and Master degree in Computer Science. 
I started my career working with Java technologies but in the last 5 years, I have been using Typescript and node. My current areas of interest are Scala (functional programming), distributed systems, and high-performance applications. I am also very into blockchain development (4 years of professional experience), its possibilities for the payments industry, and its impact on society.
I have worked in a wide variety of companies where I have adapted to very different teams: from small startups with a few number employees to big corporations. I am a good team player and enjoy sharing knowledge through pair programming: I believe good communication within the team is the most significant performance boost. 
I am a very goal-oriented person and highly motivated when it comes to learning new technologies. I believe I keep a good balance between quality and fast delivery in my job as I understand well what the most valuable areas are and I handle well technical debt.
